This add-on is based on an idea requested by Anking and developed by CravingCrates based on Glutanimate “Highlight Search”, then debugged, forked and customized by me (Shigeyuki).

 **📖 How to use :** <br>
 1. This add-on is for auto Highlight the Cloze of the selected card in the Browser.
 1. You can use it simply by downloading it.
 1. For now, if there are multiple Clozes with the same number, only `{{c0:::` will be highlighted.
 1. Highlight Colors
     1. Currently selected text -> Orange
     1. Exact match text -> Yellow
 1. If there is only one Cloze with the same number, the full text of the Cloze is highlighted.


 **🗒️Notes :** <br>
 1. Cannot highlight all Cloze at once ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
 1. Color cannot be changed.
 1. For now I checked the works on Windows only.
 1. For now there are no options.
 1. I think I will add some more features later.
